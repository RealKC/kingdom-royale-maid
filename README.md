# About

Kingdom Royale Maid is a WIP Discord bot to run the *Kingdom Royale* game from volumes 3 and 4 of the light novel *Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria*(The Empty Box and Zeroth Maria) by Eiji Mikage in a Discord server.

## What is *Kingdom Royale*?

Kingdom Royale is a "killer game" as described by a character in the book, but
in more familiar terms, Kingdom Royale is a mafia-like game, it features
competing factions battleing for supremacy, which they must achieve by killing
each other. The game as implemented in this bot requires roleplay to be
entertaining.

## Cool. How can I host it myself?

Note: kingdom-royale-maid is only supported on Arch Linux and Raspbian.

1. You will need to make a Discord application and turn it into a bot. (Google
is your friend here)
2. You will need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
3. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into a new file called `.env` in the same directory as the former, and fill in the necessary data.
4. If all went well, you can then simply run it by writing in a terminal, the
following

```sh
cargo run
```
